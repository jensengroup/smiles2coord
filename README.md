# smiles2coord
bash script to get coordinates from SMILES and Cactus. Open Babel needs to be installed.

Example:

./smiles2coord "CC"

(remember to "chmod 755 smiles2coord" the first time you use it)

The output is two files, CC.sdf and CC.xyz, containing the Cartesian coordinates of ethane in sdf and xyz format.
